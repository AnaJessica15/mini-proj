# LOAN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

- The Loan Prediction Dataset which consists of a set of 613 records under 13 attributes. 
- Dataset is split into training and testing data in the ratio 80:20. After the loading of datasets with various libraries like pandas and numpy, data preprocessing like missing value treatment of numerical and categorical is done by checking the values. 
- Numerical and categorical values are segregated.Outliers and frequency analysis are done, outliers are checked by getting the boxplot diagram of attributes. 
- Since the problem of predicting the approval of a loan application is a classification problem, the model is trained and tested using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree.
