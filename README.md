# LOAN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

- The Loan Prediction Dataset which consists of a set of 613 records under 13 attributes. 

- Dataset is split into training and testing data in the ratio 80:20. After the loading of datasets with various libraries like pandas and numpy, data preprocessing like missing value treatment of numerical and categorical is done by checking the values. 

- Numerical and categorical values are segregated.Outliers and frequency analysis are done, outliers are checked by getting the boxplot diagram of attributes. 

- Since the problem of predicting the approval of a loan application is a classification problem, the model is trained and tested using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree. 

- Testing datasets are then given to the model for the prediction of loan so that the machine can analyze and understand the process and will check for eligible applicants and give us the result.

- The Process of Modeling the Data:
   -Importing the model
   -Fitting the model
   -Predicting Loan Status
   -Classification report by Loan Status
   -Overall accuracy
   
- After that the testing dataset is used in the various machine learning algorithms and accuracy is calculated. Finally the most accurate algorithm is found.
